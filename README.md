# June 2021
Started this website  
Initially began by hosting on people.ucsc.edu/~user  
Wanted a cite that extended beyond UCSC  
Found out about hosting on github.io with Jekyll  

Had many problems getting gems and jekyll fulling installed locally, so this is the gibhub remote version.
This has some drawback in that I don't understand how everything may be modified like it would be if it were all done locally.
Another drawback is that all changes must be uploaded and pushed to github to view changes from the code.

After changes are saved locally:  
$ git add . #to stage the changes  
$ git commit -m "some comment" #to commit the change and compare versions  
$ git push #to send changes to cloud  

site wide changes are done in the _config.yml file
updates as the come should be done to web page content should be done in the _pages/*.md

#### website local file is now hosted in ~/Zephyrus_share/
Revamping linux, with ArcoLinux and i3wm
