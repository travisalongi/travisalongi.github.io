## First time attending SSA and First time convening session
I'm looking forward to attending the Seismological Society of America Spring 2022 meeting which will take place April 20 - 22.   

Here are the details for my presentation:  
+    Abstract Title: Using Active Source Seismology to Image a Strike-slip Fault Damage Zone as a Function of Depth, Distance and Geology
+    Session: Fault Damage Zones: What We Know and Do Not I
+    Date: 4/20/2022
+    Start Time for your Talk: 02:45 PM Pacific
+    Room: Grand A

I'm excited for another opportunity to present all of my research to a live audience. I have some new and thought provoking results regarding folding near the fault and the damage zone that will be very interesting to share.
