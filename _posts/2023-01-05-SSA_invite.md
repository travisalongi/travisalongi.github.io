Together with my colleagues Alba Padilla Rodriguez, Ashley Griffith, Ahmed Elbana, and Prithvi Thakur, we will be convening a session at the Seismologic Society of America's annual spring meeting. The meeting will take place April 17-20 2023 in San Juan, Puerto Rico. We will have two invited speakers that will provide some exciting new research and provide some context for the session. Last year Alba and I convened a very successful session on the fault damage zone at SSA, and we're hoping to have another successful session this year. Please submit an abstract to our session!

### Abstract  
#### Above the Seismogenic Zone: Fault Damage and Healing in the Shallow Crust  
Fault damage zones provide a window into the inelastic processes and products that result from coseismic stress changes. The spatial extent of fault damage during earthquakes is greatest in the upper-most kilometers of the crust, above the seismogenic zone. Inelastic processes within this volume modify the bulk long-term properties of the shallow crust, increasing local seismic hazard through enhanced shaking. Fault damage zones have attracted the interest of a broad range of geoscientists because of their relevance to fundamental earthquake physics problems, i.e., the earthquake energy balance, strong ground motions and near fault fluid flow. Higher resolution datasets, a growing number of observations and increased computational power have advanced our understanding of the spatial extent, physical properties and time-integrated evolution of the shallow portion of damage zones. Our understanding of fault damage zones, the processes that form them and their feedbacks with various phases of the earthquake cycle is improving; however, there remain many unanswered questions such as the mechanism and rate of fault healing above the seismogenic zone, the role of subsidiary faults on earthquake nucleation and a complete model that extends damage observed at the surface to seismogenic depth. In this session, we welcome contributions and recent advances in the quantitative understanding of the shallow properties of fault damage 4 zones. We are particularly interested in contributions that explore and combine observations, laboratory experiments, numerical modeling and theoretical studies.
