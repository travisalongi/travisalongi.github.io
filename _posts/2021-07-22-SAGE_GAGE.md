Later this month (Wed, August 18, 2021 09:00 Pacific time) I will be presenting some of my work on the Cascadia subduction zone, at the Unavco GAGE/SAGE 2021 Community Science Worshop. I will be presenting a poster as well as an 3 minute E-lighting talk in the section /Fault Dynamics and Hazards (Western North America Emphasis)/.
