Later this month (Wed, August 18, 2021 09:00 Pacific time) I will be presenting some of my work on the Cascadia subduction zone, *Unavco's GAGE/SAGE 2021 Community Science Worshop**. This will be another virtual conference and easy to attend. I will be presenting a poster as well as an 3 minute E-lighting talk in the section _Fault Dynamics and Hazards (Western North America Emphasis)__.  
  
Here is the website if you'd like to attend.
