# Above the Seismogenic Zone: Fault Damage and Healing in the Shallow Crust
  
Together with my colleagues Alba Padilla Rodriguez, Ashley Griffith, Ahmed Elbana, and Prithvi Thakur, we will be convening a session at the Seismologic Society of America's annual spring meeting. The meeting will take place April 17-20 2023 in San Juan, Puerto Rico. We will have two invited speakers that will provide some exciting new research and provide some context for the session. Last year Alba and I convened a very successful session on the fault damage zone at SSA, and we're hoping to have another successful session this year. Please submit an abstract to our session!
