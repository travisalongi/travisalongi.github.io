#### Workshop Update 
My presentation at the SAGE/GAGE workshop was a success! I had many interesting questions durring the questions and answers portion of the session. There was substantial interest in the strain transient that appears to be related to the Fortuna seismicity cluster that is discussed extensively in the [2021 JGR paper](../../../assets/Files/Alongi_etal_2021JB022180_published.pdf). It's still so fascinating that these events abruptly activate at the time of the geodetically identified strain change. I'm excited to see if this area or other areas are identified in the future to have similar behavior.  

#### Latest Task
Recently I've been trying to use paleostratigraphic and geophysical well logs to better sort out the stratigraphy in the Palos Verdes Fault seismic volumes. I've recently acquired and fixed a version of the larger Chevron volume. This continuous seismic volume will allow better mapping of horizons, which tied to the well logs will provide better constraints on the distinct lithologies in the volume. I have been developing a code to utilize the horizons to constrain portions of the volume. The goal here is to analyze the damage zone within specific units.
