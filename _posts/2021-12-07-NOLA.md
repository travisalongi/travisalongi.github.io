## 5th AGU
2021 American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting will be the 5th time that I have attended AGU. I have attended this meeting in consecutive years since 2017. In previous years these meetings have hosted around 30,000 participants and have been the /biggest/ meeting of the year. I remember my first AGU and being blown away by all the people, all the hustle and bustle of the meeting, and loads of fascinating science that I had not thought of before. This year I think things are going to be very different, and it seems that in person participation will be drastically reduced from those first years that I attended. I'm not sure what to expect with this hybrid format. My main focus has always been the oral presentations, especially for subjects that outside of my wheel house because there is always an introduction and a well thought out presentation. I have always aspired to give an oral presentation at this meeting because it always seemed so prestigous and such a cool thing, and this year I'm giving one, granted it's going to be in different hybrid format. I think my in person talk will basically be an elevator pitch for people to watch the full recorded talk. I'm excited and nervous to get up onstage infront of my peers and really put my science out there.  

Fingers crossed for a good turnout and good feedback!
