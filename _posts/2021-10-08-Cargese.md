## Cargese (Corsica) Earthquake Workshop 
Last week I was fortunate enough to attend the 3rd edition of the Cargese Earthquake Workshop / Summer School in Corsica, France. This was one of the best experiences that I have had as a graduate student. The aim of the workshop is for early career (meaning PhD candidates and post-docs) and was focused on what we know about earthquakes as well as many unanswered questions in the field such as Moment/Duration scaling of earthquakes and slow-slip events, pre-slip vs cascade earthquake models, as well as the known and unknown in rate and state friction. Not only was this an excellent opportunity to recap earthquake science and present my own work, but also meet many European scientists that I have not had the chance to interact with.  

Additionally this was my first international trip and an eye opening experience. I was fortunate enough to get to see a bit of Paris during the layover between Paris and Ajaccio, Corsica. I caught glimpses of the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame, and the Louvre! I swam in the Mediterranean sea (which is much more salty, clear, and warm than the Pacific or Atlantic Oceans), and got to explore Ajaccio and hike around the area, and wow that island is incredibly beautiful with much more topographic relief than I had imagined! I plan on doing more international travel and hope to see more of the world.
