I hope you're attending SCEC this year! Apparently there are > 600 posters available during their online annual meeting. This is going to be a super exciting event, and was easily the best online conference that I attended last year! I plan to post a link to my poster in an update in case you forgot to register and want to check it out.

Follow this link to see my abstract. I'll post other information as it comes through.
