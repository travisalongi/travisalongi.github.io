## Wrapping up
Hi folks,   
  
On October 10, 2023 I defended my PhD in person and via zoom. The title of my talk was "Understanding Fault Damage and Slip with Marine Seismic Methods" and included a brief discription of the science questions addressed in each of the three chapters in my dissertation. The audience had good questions and feedback and was overall a /very/ good experience.  
  
I will be starting a Mendenhall Postdoc postition at the United States Geologic Survey in the next few months and I'll have some interesting new science stuff to post about soon.  
  
## Stay Tuned
