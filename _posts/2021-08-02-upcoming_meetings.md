Many upcoming meetings and events this fall! In addition to the SAGE/GAGE workshop, I have submitted abstracts to the [Earthquakes (3rd edition) Nucleation, Triggering, and Relationshipos with Aseismic Prcoesses Workshop](https://earthquakes3.sciencesconf.org/) [2021 SCEC Annual Meeting](https://www.scec.org/meetings), and [2021 AGU Fall Meeting](https://www.agu.org/Fall-Meeting). Two out of three of these meetings are planned for in person attending. I'm looking forward to all these opportunities to learn and promote my science.  I am very excited to reconnect with old friends and make new connections **in person**!
