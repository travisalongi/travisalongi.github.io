## About

I am a postdoc at the Earthquake Science Center in Moffett Field, California. I am currently working on a project / algorithm to generate three-dimensional fault geometires from the spatial patterns of seismicity combined with focal mechanisms. The initial testing phases of this work are being applied to the San Juan Bautista region of California which is the confluence of two major faults as well as transition in coupling along both faults.    

During my PhD I developed methods for analyzing the spatial patterns of fault damage zones along the Palos Verdes Fault in California, with multi-resolution seismic reflection data. I also created a high quality microseismicity catalog for the Mendocino Triple Junction region of Northern California / Southern Cascadia to help understand the state of coupling along the megathrust.
