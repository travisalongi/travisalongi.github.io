## About

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Earthquake Science Center in Moffett Field, California. My current project focuses on developing an innovative algorithm to generate three-dimensional fault geometries by analyzing the spatial patterns of seismicity combined with focal mechanisms. This advancement in the field is initially being tested in the San Juan Bautista region of California, a critical area where two major faults intersect and coupling transitions occur.    

During my PhD at UC Santa Cruz I specialized in analyzing the spatial patterns of fault damage zones along the Palos Verdes Fault in California using multi-resolution marine seismic reflection datasets. This gave me the opportunity to use existing datasets as well as collect new high-resolution data and develop seismic processing skills. Additionally, I created a high-quality microseismicity catalog for the Mendocino Triple Junction region of Northern California/Southern Cascadia, providing valuable insight into the state of coupling along the megathrust.
