I am a *seismologist & geophysist* Ph.D. candidate in the Earth and Planetary Science department at the University of California, Santa Cruz. 
I am doing researching in the Seismology Lab with UCSC professors [Emily Brodsky](https://websites.pmc.ucsc.edu/~seisweb/emily_brodsky/) and [Susan Schwartz](https://websites.pmc.ucsc.edu/~seisweb/susan_schwartz/). I collaborate with USGS researchers [Jared Kluesner](https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/jared-kluesner?qt-staff_profile_science_products=0#qt-staff_profile_science_products) and [Danny Brothers](https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/danny-brothers?qt-staff_profile_science_products=0#qt-staff_profile_science_products).

I use both **passive** (earthquakes) and **active** (human-created) seismic methods to interrogate Earth's subsurface. I am interested in understanding the environment that hosts earthquakes and what role fault damage plays in the long term seismic cycle, nucleation and arrest of earthquakes.

My research uses seismic waves to probe faults in-situ in the earth. I am particular fascinated by the 3D spatial distribution of subsidiary faults, fractures, and deformation around faults. I seek to answer the questions of how lithology, depth, and fault morphology may control earthquakes.
