I am a *Seismologist & Geophysist* and a Ph.D. candidate in the Earth and Planetary Science department at the University of California, Santa Cruz. 
I am conducting research in the Seismology Lab with UCSC professors [Emily Brodsky](https://websites.pmc.ucsc.edu/~seisweb/emily_brodsky/) and [Susan Schwartz](https://websites.pmc.ucsc.edu/~seisweb/susan_schwartz/), and I collaborate with USGS researchers [Jared Kluesner](https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/jared-kluesner?qt-staff_profile_science_products=0#qt-staff_profile_science_products) and [Danny Brothers](https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/danny-brothers?qt-staff_profile_science_products=0#qt-staff_profile_science_products).

I am interested in using seismic waves to understand faults in-situ within the earth. 

I use both passive (earthquakes) and active (human created) source seismic methods.
