I am a *Seismologist & Geophysist* and a Ph.D. candidate in the Earth and Planetary Science department at the University of California, Santa Cruz. 
I am researching in the Seismology Lab with UCSC professors [Emily Brodsky](https://websites.pmc.ucsc.edu/~seisweb/emily_brodsky/) and [Susan Schwartz](https://websites.pmc.ucsc.edu/~seisweb/susan_schwartz/). I collaborate with USGS researchers [Jared Kluesner](https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/jared-kluesner?qt-staff_profile_science_products=0#qt-staff_profile_science_products) and [Danny Brothers](https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/danny-brothers?qt-staff_profile_science_products=0#qt-staff_profile_science_products).

I am interested in using seismic waves to understand faults in-situ within the earth. In particular, I am fascinated by the 3D spatial distribution of subsidiary faults and fractures around major faults and how lithology, depth, and fault morphology may control the generation of these features and control seismic and aseismic processes.

I use both **passive** (earthquakes) and **active** (human-created) seismic methods. A long-term goal is to connect (relatively) shallow earthquakes to seismic imagery to understand the environment where earthquakes nucleate.
