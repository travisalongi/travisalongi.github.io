I am a Mendenhall Research Geophysicist at the Earthquake Science Center at the U.S. Geological Survey in Moffett Field, California.

I use both **passive** (earthquakes) and **active** (human-created) seismic methods to interrogate the Earth's subsurface. I am interested in understanding the environment that hosts earthquakes and what role fault damage plays in the long term seismic cycle, nucleation and arrest of earthquakes.

My research uses seismic waves to understand faults in-situ. I am particularly interested in the 3D spatial distribution of faults, fractures, and deformation around faults. My research seeks to answer questions of how fault morphology and rock lithology at seismogenic depths may control earthquakes.
