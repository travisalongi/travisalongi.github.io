I am a Seismologist/Geophysist and a Ph.D. candidate in the Earth and Planetary Science department at the University of California, Santa Cruz. I am conducting research in the Seismology Lab with UCSC professors [Emily Brodsky] (https://websites.pmc.ucsc.edu/~seisweb/emily_brodsky/) and [Susan Schwartz] (https://websites.pmc.ucsc.edu/~seisweb/susan_schwartz/), and I colaborate with USGS researchers Jared Kluesner and Danny Brothers

I am interested in using seismic waves to understand faults within the earth. Since faults are below ground seismology can be used to learn about faults in-situ and depth.

I use both passive and active source seismic methods.
