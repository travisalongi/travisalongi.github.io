## More Coming Soon!
#### Active Source 3D Fault Identification
The 3D damage zone structure is poorly understood. 
Using openly available legacy industry collected 3D marine seismic data I identify faults and fractures surfaces using a modern seismic attribute. 
I am working on quantifying the spatial relationship of the algorithically identified fault and fractures network with major regional fault strands.

#### Cascadia Initiative Yr 4 Earthquake Locations
Manually identify earthquakes by visual inspection of waveforms. 
Preform both absolute and relative relocations. 
Template match earthquakes that are near the plate boundary. 
Results suggest that plate interface seismicity near Fortuna (yellow box) are sensitive to local long term strain-transients.
