## More Coming Soon!
#### Active Source: 3D Fault Identification
The 3D damage zone structure is poorly understood. 
Using openly available legacy industry collected 3D marine seismic data I identify faults and fractures surfaces using a modern seismic attribute. 
I am working on quantifying the spatial relationship of the algorithically identified fault and fractures network with major regional fault strands.

#### Seismology: Earthquake Locations
Aseismic slow slip events are ubiquitious at plate bounding faults. 
There appears to be relationship between aseismic strain transients and microseismicity.
By doing a thorough seismic study of earthquakes near the plate interface using an dense seismic array we find a cluster of earthquakes (yellow box) that appear to be sensitive to local long term strain-transients.

#### Multi-Channel Seismic Processing
Modern advanced seismic processing techniques provide a high resolution image of the subsurface. 
I am working on developing workflows that provide crisp seismic images, this is done by reduce acquisition imposed artifacts, and the elimination of ghosts and multiples. 
Removing the source signiture and the noise helps for the identification of active deformation and faulting.
