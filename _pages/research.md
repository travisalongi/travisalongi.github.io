#### Active Source: 3D Fault Identification
The 3D fault networks and damage zone structure is poorly understood. 
Using openly available 3D marine reflection seismic data I identify faults and fractures surfaces using modern seismic attribute methods. 
I am working on quantifying the spatial relationship of the algorithmically identified fault and fractures network with mapped fault strands. I am exploring a lithological and/or depth dependence on fault damage.

#### Seismology: Microseismicity and Slow Slip
Aseismic slow slip events are ubiquitious at plate bounding faults. 
There appears to be relationship between aseismic strain transients and microseismicity.
A thorough seismic study of earthquakes near the plate interface using an dense seismic array reveals a cluster of earthquakes (yellow box) that appear to be sensitive to local long term strain-transients.

#### Multi-Channel Seismic Processing
Modern advanced seismic processing techniques provide a high resolution image of the subsurface. 
I am working on developing workflows that provide high quality seismic images, and utilizing new tools that reduce acquisition imposed artifacts and eliminate ghosts and multiples. 
careful seismic processing helps to reduce noise aiding in identifying zones of active deformation and faulting.
