## More Coming Soon!
#### Active Source 3D Fault Identification
Using openly available legacy industry collected marine seismic data to identify faults and fractures using a modern seismic attribute. 
Quantify the spatial relationship of the algorithically identified fault and fractures with the major fault strands.

#### Cascadia Initiative Yr 4 Earthquake Locations
Manually identify earthquakes by visual inspection of waveforms. 
Preform both absolute and relative relocations. 
Template match earthquakes that are near the plate boundary. 
Results suggest that plate interface seismicity near Fortuna (yellow box) are sensitive to local long term strain-transients.
